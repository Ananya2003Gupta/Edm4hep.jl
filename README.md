# EDM4hep.jl: A Prototypic Edm4hep Julia Package
[![Build Status](https://github.com/Ananya2003Gupta/Edm4hep.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Ananya2003Gupta/Edm4hep.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

**Package:** EDM4hep.jl

**Version:** 1.0.0-DEV

**License:** MIT

## **Description:**

This package provides a prototypic implementation of the EDM4hep data model in Julia. 
EDM4hep is a generic event data model designed for future HEP collider experiments. 

This Julia package offers in-memory representation of the datamodel's components and datatypes, including:

* **Components:** Represented by mutable structs with constructor definitions.
* **Datatypes:** Represented by mutable structs with constructor and collection definitions.

This package is currently under development and does not yet have I/O functionality. It focuses on providing a foundation for building future versions with full EDM4hep support in Julia.

## **Features:**

* In-memory representation of EDM4hep components and datatypes.
* Mutable structs for efficient data manipulation.
* Constructor definitions for creating data objects.
* Collection definitions for managing groups of objects.

## **Dependencies:**

**StaticArrays:** A Julia package for statically sized arrays.

## **Installation:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ananya2003Gupta/Edm4hep.jl.git`
2. Run `julia` and within the REPL, type `using Pkg; Pkg.add("EDM4hep.jl")`.

## **Usage Examples:**

```julia
using EDM4hep

mcp1 = MCParticle()
mcp1.PDG = 1210

mcp2 = MCParticle()
mcp2.PDG = 1212

mcp3 = MCParticle()
mcp3.PDG = 101
push!(mcp3.parents,mcp1)

mcp4 = MCParticle()
mcp4.PDG = 110
push!(mcp4.parents,mcp2)

mcp5 = MCParticle()
mcp5.PDG = 111
push!(mcp5.parents,mcp1)
push!(mcp5.parents,mcp2)

```

## **Motivation:**

This package aims to bridge the gap between EDM4hep and the Julia ecosystem, facilitating the development of tools and applications for HEP data analysis using Julia's powerful features and expressiveness.

## **Future Plans:**

The future development of this package includes:

* Implementing I/O functionality for reading and writing EDM4hep data.
* Providing additional utilities and tools for working with EDM4hep data in Julia.

## **Links:**

* EDM4hep: [key4hep/EDM4hep](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep)
* PODIO: [AIDASoft/podio](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio)
* EDM4hep datamodel: [edm4hep.yaml](https://github.com/key4hep/EDM4hep/blob/main/edm4hep.yaml)

## **Branches:**

* `main`: Contains the current design with individual files for mutable struct definition of components and datatypes.
* `v002`: Contains an alternative design with a single file for all component and datatype mutable struct definitions.

Please note that both branches are experimental and may undergo further changes in the future.

## Generating Julia Files from PODIO

This package provides a prototypic implementation of the EDM4hep data model in Julia. The initial code generation was performed using the PODIO library:

```
python podio_class_generator.py --lang julia <path/to/>edm4hep.yaml edm4hep_julia edm4hep ROOT
```

This command generates all Julia files into the `edm4hep_julia/edm4hep` directory. These generated files served as the foundation for the current package structure.

**Please note:** While the basic functionalities are implemented, the generated code may undergo further modifications and improvements in future versions.
